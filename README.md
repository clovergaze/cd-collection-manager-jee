# CD Collection Manager (JEE)

A simple sample application that uses Java/Jakarta EE technologies.

## About

The application uses JPA, EJBs and JSF with [BootsFaces](https://www.bootsfaces.net/) and was developed
for [WilfFly](http://wildfly.org/). Although the underlying data model is very simple, it has a repository layer and a
service layer, that is used by page backing beans.

For simplicity the application uses an H2 in-memory database as datasource, but this can easily be changed to any other
database using the WildFly datasource configuration.

## How to build

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is used to build the program from source code.
Just execute the following Maven goals to build and package the application:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

As mentioned earlier an in-memory H2 database is used as datasource, so if WildFly is used no further configuration is
required. To use another database simply configure one called `CDCollectionManagerDS`.
